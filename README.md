# TokamakDisruptionPredictions

This project explores a simplified simulation or analysis related to tokamak reactorsâ€”devices designed to confine plasma using magnetic fields for the purpose of achieving controlled nuclear fusion. Tokamaks are a central focus of fusion research due to their potential to provide clean, virtually limitless energy. The goal of this project is to model, analyze, or solve a computational problem relevant to the behavior of plasma inside a tokamak reactor, such as magnetic confinement, energy balance, or particle motion. It serves as an educational tool or starting point for further study into plasma physics, computational modeling, or fusion energy systems.

The script generates a graph that visualizes the  signal amplitude versus the time step. Demonstrating how the disrupted and normal signals for plasma, magnetic, and density changes. This helps illustrate the behavior of plasma or magnetic fields inside a tokamak under simplified assumptions.
